# Social_media_Comments_Analysis

Youtube is a great place for many content creators to upload their videos and allows viewers to comment, like, and share the video. When there are an immense number of comments on a video, it is practically not possible to reply to each and every one of them by the creator, so we provide an ML solution that replies to comments automatically. Also, this corpus of comments provides a very interesting opportunity to grab the overall sentiment of the comment section and ideas for future videos.
